# Head First Python Exercises

This repository includes some exercises from the book [Head First Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-python/9781449397524/).
I totally recommend this book if you want an introduction to Python language. As you can see in this 
repository, the book is full of examples so you can practice some of the concepts.
